# First time setup

Start off by cloning the repository onto your local machine.

Now, you'll want to `cd` into the `backend` folder. Run `npm i` to install any needed packages.

Similarily, you'll want to `cd` into the `frontend` folder, and run `npm i` to install the needed packages for the client side of the app as well.

This should be all you need to get setup initially before running the app!

# Running the application locally

Then simply start up the server on your computer by running `npm run dev`. This will spin up the backend server.

NOTE: a reminder that any changes locally done to `server.ts` will not be testable until you restart the server (killing the process and running `npm run dev` again)

Your backend should be up and running. Great! Now simply navigate to the `frontend` repository and run an `npm start`

This will start up the client side application. This may take a few seconds!

Congratulations, you should now have the app fully running! ðŸŽ‰
